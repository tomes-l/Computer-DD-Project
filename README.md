# Computer-DD-Project

This is a personal project that aim to download and pre-process biological activity data to build machine learning models. 

The dataset is comprised of compounds (molecules) that have been biologically tested for their activity towards target organism/protein of interest (here we'll look at acetylcholinesterase).

*This project allows me to handle different process of **"data mining"** as it can be ask in academic/professional environnement.*


*NB:* The ML part is on the beginning
